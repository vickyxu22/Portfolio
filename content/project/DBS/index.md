### Report 1: Negative Weight Detection

Time Dimension:
Across the years, 2021 saw stable negative frequencies, 2022 witnessed a shift with other waste leading, and 2023 showed kitchen waste taking the lead with smaller differences.

Category Breakdown:
Kitchen waste negatives increased yearly, while recyclable and other waste initially increased but then declined. Notably, 2022 had significantly higher negative rates for recyclable and other waste.

Actual Weight Negative Levels and Impact:
For strong negative weight waste, a brief delivery time yielded an estimated weight of -19.83 kg. Medium and weak negative weight impacts were negligible, with statistical significance (p < 0.01) indicating a 0.19 kg decrease per second for strong negative weight waste.
