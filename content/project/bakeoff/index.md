Examining the financial ties between dentists and the industry is crucial, given the challenges Massachusetts residents face in accessing dental care. Using the Open Payments Dataset, managed by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, I aim to analyze the $1,893,633 sum of 5,166 payments in dentistry. This investigation will shed light on the distribution of payments across dental specialties, the correlation between received funds and payment nature, the link between months and payments, and the overall financial relationship between drug companies and dental physicians. This study fills a gap in existing research, as there are currently no studies on the financial dynamics within the dental field.
