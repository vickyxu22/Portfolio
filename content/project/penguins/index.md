College students are increasingly identifying with the disability term, but need more institutional support and visibility around disability. Data science (DS) attracts a lot of undergraduate students and should consider disability inclusion topics in its curriculum design to help raise disability awareness among students and include diverse students to drive innovation of the field. The data used in this study was collected in an Introduction to DS course that applied disability inclusion datasets. This study aims to understand how disability inclusion datasets are helpful for learning coding skills, feeling belonging to the DS field, and raising disability awareness. The results showed that students who put more effort in the disability inclusion datasets found them more helpful for coding skills improvement. Moreover, incorporating disability inclusion datasets in introductory DS pedagogy appeared to be helpful for underrepresented students to feel belonging to the DS field and raise disability awareness among students.
