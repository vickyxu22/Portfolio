  * Code for Good
  
  As a research assistant at the [Disability and Inclusion lab](https://scao53.github.io/), I focused on analyzing environmental barriers for disabled employees across industries. Our team attended the ASA [Women in Statistical and Data Science Conference](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2023/conferenceinfo.cfm) 2023 in Seattle. Additionally, I leveraged technology by creating a PostgreSQL dashboard to monitor garbage delivery to 40k+ households, contributing to the improvement of [Ningbo City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo)'s garbage sorting system. At [Crib LLC](https://linktr.ee/crib.subleasing), I collaborated closely with the startup core team on tech solutions to enhance the accessibility and affordability of housing resources in NYC. Whether analyzing data or developing applications, my greatest satisfaction lies in leveraging technology for tangible positive impact, contributing to making the world a better place.
  
  * CS + Art = ?
  
  Immersing myself in calligraphy, art history, and serving as a database intern at the [SCMA](https://scma.smith.edu/) has profoundly shaped my life and aspirations. Art, being a profound reflection of its respective era, encapsulates the essence of culture, education, and aesthetic appreciation, fueling my desire to utilize machine learning as a tool for investigating the evolution, connections, and migrations of artwork across different periods, as well as applying database skills to enhance artwork archiving in institutions. Furthermore, my curiosity extends to the realms of computer graphics, where I aim to explore the intersection of technology and artistic expression.
  
  * Women in STEM
  
  Leading the [Smith College Data Science Club](https://linktr.ee/smithiesinsds) as president, my commitment is to enhance our campus with additional resources and cultivate an inclusive and friendly environment for girls. Through the initiation of the podcast '[SibTalk - Data Science Journey](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XNRFeVs3gOGnfzRT1c51T?si=c6bfaaf74a8943e5&nd=1)', with episodes available on Spotify, I lead the club in interviewing accomplished alumni. This initiative allows aspiring data enthusiasts to learn from their experiences, empowering them wherever and whenever they may be. Additionally, I have recently founded and prepared the [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) college loop at Smith, which will be officially launched in Spring 2024.
