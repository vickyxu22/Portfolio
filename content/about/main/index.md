  As a research assistant at the Disability and Inclusion lab, I focused on analyzing environmental barriers for disabled employees across industries. Our team attended the ASA Women in Statistical and Data Science Conference 2023 in Seattle. Additionally, I leveraged technology by creating a PostgreSQL dashboard to monitor garbage delivery to 40k+ households, contributing to the improvement of Ningbo City's garbage sorting system. At Crib LLC, I collaborated closely with the startup core team on tech solutions to enhance the accessibility and affordability of housing resources in NYC. 
  
  Whether analyzing data or developing applications, my greatest satisfaction lies in leveraging technology for tangible positive impact, contributing to making the world a better place.
